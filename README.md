# M5Stick-NEMO
M5 Stick C firmware for high-tech pranks

## Name
NEMO is named after the small, clever and headstrong fish in Finding Nemo. This project stands in contrast to other gadgets that have become associated with certain sea-dwelling creatures.

## Features
* [TV B-Gone](http://www.righto.com/2010/11/improved-arduino-tv-b-gone.html) port (thanks to MrArm's [HAKRWATCH](https://github.com/MrARM/hakrwatch)) to shut off many infrared-controlled TVs, projectors and other devices
* [AppleJuice](https://github.com/ECTO-1A/AppleJuice) iOS Bluetooth device pairing spam
* WiFi Spam - Both a list of funny SSIDs, and the usual WiFi Rickrolling
* 24 Hour digital clock backed by the M5 Stick RTC so it holds relatively stable time even in deep sleep and low battery mode
* Settings for rotation, clock time adjustment, automatic dimming, as well as battery level and credits
